# spectral-turbulent-kinetic-energy-for-an-entire-channel-flow
This repository contains codes for calculating production, dissipation and nonlinear transfer for an entire channel flow. For a statistically steady channel flow, production, dissipation and nonlinear transfer achieve a balance for each Fourier mode.
